# Hi, I'm Tina, welcome to my repository

I'm currently attending a coding cohort with MIT. I will be using this repository to store my coding projects
through out the course. I'm very excited with what I have learned so far and can't wait to see my progression.

The very first activity we did was to create a webpage which is the one you see here in this repository, being brand
new to coding, it was a tricky thing to learn at first but i eventually figured it out with the help of all the great 
open source resources this awesome community has. 

Stay tuned for more.....
